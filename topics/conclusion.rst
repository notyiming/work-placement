Future Career Planning
----------------------
Working as a software engineer intern at Qualcomm for these past few months has led me to realize that 
how lucky and fortunate I am to have chosen the right major and career path three years ago. 
I love what I do, I enjoy working as a software engineer, I love all the aspects of it, I really do. 
This current internship at Qualcomm just further deepened and strengthened my passion for software engineering. 
I am very thankful for Qualcomm for giving me this fantastic opportunity and experience. 
I now have no doubt about what I want to do in the future, my future goal is very I want to be 
the best software engineer I possibly can.

Last Words
----------
All in all, I absolutely enjoy my time here currently in Qualcomm. 
This has been the best time and experience for me as a software development student here in Cork, Ireland. 
Even though it has only been 5 months, I know for a fact that I have learnt and grew so much. 
I am being taught the best practices of coding in Python and software development in general by the best engineers. 
Not only that, but I can also tell that my soft skills have improved significantly as well. 
I learned how to communicate with a professional manner, how to interact with other engineers and build meaningful 
connections and relationships not just here in Cork, but also in San Diego and Bangalore. 
I can confidently say that Qualcomm is a great place to work in, and I am going to keep it up, 
do my best and enjoy the rest of the internship!
