Conclusion
----------
All in all, I absolutely enjoy my time here currently in Qualcomm. 
This has been the best time and experience for me as a software development student here in Cork, Ireland. 
Even though it has only been 5 months, I know for a fact that I have learnt and grew so much. 
I am being taught the best practices of coding in Python and software development in general by the best engineers. 
Not only that, but I can also tell that my soft skills have improved significantly as well. 
I learned how to communicate with a professional manner, how to interact with other engineers and build meaningful 
connections and relationships not just here in Cork, but also in San Diego and Bangalore. 
I can confidently say that Qualcomm is a great place to work in, and I am going to keep it up, 
do my best and enjoy the rest of the internship until September 16th.
