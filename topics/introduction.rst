Introduction
------------

My name is Tan, Yi Ming. I am third year student from Malaysia, studying software development in MTU Cork. 
I am currently working as a software engineer intern at Qualcomm as part of the work placement module of the course.

To me, doing internships in general is extremely valuable as it helps to gain real-world software engineering knowledge and experience. 
And I am fortunate enough to be learning from Qualcomm, one of the best technology companies in the world. 
I honestly believe that gaining work experience during college provides a huge head start advantage. 
It prepares me for my future career with real meaningful work experience under my belt straight out of university.

This is my second internship with Qualcomm. I did a 10 week summer internship with Qualcomm from July to September 2021, 
fully remote. I absolutely loved it, I enjoyed my time working in the company, 
I learnt so much within the 10 week period and I am glad to be doing my third year work placement here at Qualcomm again in 2022.

My current work placement duration is set to start from the 4th of January 2022, 
and the end date is recently extended from June to September 16th. Mode of work is blended, 
I can either work remotely from home or in the Penrose Dock, Cork office. My line manager is Mohamed Wahbi, 
he is the one I go to if I have any questions about the internship, the work, career or life advice and many more. 
I also report to my project manager Kalpesh Shah from Bangalore, India, whom I work with in an infrastructure project team.
