Reflection

The first month was pretty laid back. It was basically just setting up my work environment.
Spent some time getting to know my new team members better, as well as reading project documentations, 
and diving into the codebase, trying to understand the project better. Overall the orientation experience has 
been great even though everything was done remotely.

I would say that February is the month which I really start to pick up some new topics. 
I feel more integrated into the team since I started working on some tasks, and doing code
reviews with other engineers. I feel good as I now understand more about the project and 
also starting to contribute to the team.

March is the month where I first introduced a new major idea to the team which the team adopted.
I am very happy that the team liked the idea and decided to integrate it into the project. This
might be the first moment where I am truly impactful and giving good contributions. March is also 
the month where all engineers are allowed to come work in the office. I love working in the office 
as I can interact with other interns and engineers in person.

Our team released a new version of the software this month. I now realize even more how

May is the month where I truly feel more comfortable with the codebase, and more confident working on tasks by myself. 
I am farmiliar with the codebase architecture way more compared to when I first joined. I am not afraid to speak out my mind,
my ideas, opinions on topics. I find myself more in important discussion meetings. I almost feel like I am one of them now, 
and not just an intern anymore.
