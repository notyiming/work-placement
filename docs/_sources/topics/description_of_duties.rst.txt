Main Functions
--------------
I work as a software engineering intern, I work with an infrastructure team based mainly in Bangalore, India. 
We are working on developing an internal tool for Qualcomm engineers. 
This is a multinational team, consisting of team members across India, Ireland, and the USA.

My scope of work in this team project is quite broad. I am responsible for:

#. Setting up and the maintenance of our project documentation via Sphinx

    Before I joined, the project documentation is only hosted on confluence. 
    It wasn't very detailed or tidy. So I took the initiative to suggest the team that we should 
    use Sphinx to document our project.
    The team liked the suggestion and so we started documenting our code. 
    Sphinx documentation is then included in the next release of our software, 
    and will continue to be included for the future releases.

#. Debugging and fixing bugs

    I also do spend some time debugging and fixing bugs from the tickets I got assigned to. 
    Some of the tickets are raised by us developers internally, while some others are raised by
    our clients from other teams. I also help out my team debug together at times via pair programming.

#. New feature implementation with unittesting, good coverage and pylint scores

    I also get tasked to implement new software features or enhancements. 
    After going through a Python training provided by an engineer in Qualcomm regarding Test Driven Development, 
    I now write tests first before writing code. This in turn results in higher code coverage score because 
    I am only writing code that is needed by the unittests to pass. 
    Coverage is a measure, noting what parts of the code have been executed, mostly used to test the 
    effectiveness of tests. Pylint is a code analysis tool to identify errors in Python code and helps
    developers enforce good coding style and habits. I strive for the highest possible coverage and pylint scores when coding.

#. Refactoring and rearchitecting parts of the codebase to meet good standards

    Sometimes, I get tasked with some code refactoring tasks. The point of these tasks are basically to improve 
    code quality, readability, performance and maintainability. The team mainly codes in Python in this project, and in 
    Python, there is this thing called the ``Zen of Python``, which is basically a collection of 19 "guiding principles" for 
    writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language.
    The team is highly encouraged to follow the Zen of Python or any good software engineering principles in general 
    as closely as possible.
