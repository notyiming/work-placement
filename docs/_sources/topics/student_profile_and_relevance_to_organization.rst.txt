Relevance between the role and degree program
---------------------------------------------
The fact that I am a software development student means that I at least have the 
foundation level and understanding of software engineering. With that, I am able to dive into codebase and pick up quickly, 
identify what project architecture and design patterns used, be better at knowing what to expect in general. 
In team collaboration aspect, I can work with any team in an agile manner, meaning working in sprints, 
using ticket filing system such as Jira, attending stand-up meetings. 
In technical/programming aspect, I can contribute to the project with good quality code within short lead time, 
along with good documentation and readability.
This is all due to fact that I learnt the core topics of software engineering in college such as OOP, the Python language, 
basic unit testing, code documenting concepts, and agile methodologies.
In a nutshell, this role is completely relevant to my degree in college.
