Contributions brought to the role that is relevant to the degree program
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fact that I am a software development student means that I at least have the 
foundation level and understanding of software engineering. With that, I can dive into codebase and pick up quickly, 
knowing what basic project architecture looks like, knowing the common design patterns, knowing what to expect in general. 
In team collaboration aspect, I can work with any team in an agile manner, meaning working in sprints, 
using ticket filing system such as Jira, attending stand-up meetings. 
This is due to an important class I took during last semester where I was taught about Agile Methodologies. 
In technical/programming aspect, I can contribute to the project with good quality code within short lead time, 
along with good documentation and readability due to fact that I learnt OOP, the Python language, 
basic unit testing and code documenting concepts in college.
