Future Career Planning
----------------------
Working as a software engineer intern at Qualcomm for these past few months has led me to realize that 
how lucky and fortunate I am to have chosen the right major and career path three years ago. 
I love what I do, I enjoy working as a software engineer, I love all the aspects of it, I really do. 
This current internship at Qualcomm just further deepened my passion for software engineering. 
I am very thankful for Qualcomm for giving me this fantastic opportunity and experience. 
I now have no doubt about what I want to do in the future, my future goal is very I want to be 
the best software engineer I possibly can.
