<h2>LO1 Critically analyze the enterprise, its culture and organization<a class="headerlink" href="#lo1-critically-analyze-the-enterprise-its-culture-and-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Qualcomm Ireland has a very good working culture as it stresses a lot on work-life balance.
There isn’t any sort of micromanagement in the workplace.
It is flexi-hours, so as long as you don’t miss any meetings and you can get work done, it doesn’t matter what time you clock in or clock out.
People in Qualcomm are super nice, helpful, kind and always want the best for me.
I especially love the culture in my team, where we have weekly technical tips sharing session which I find very helpful.
Moreover, we also have a lot of social gatherings and team events such as team lunches, dinners, team building activities such as karting, hiking.</p>

<h2>LO2 Communicate in a professional manner within the workplace<a class="headerlink" href="#lo2-communicate-in-a-professional-manner-within-the-workplace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Good and professional communication is crucial in any team or any organization.
I am a lot more confident about my communication skills now that I have conducted code reviews with other engineers,
raised and proposed new different ideas to the team, gave training about specific topics to engineers, and many other occasions.
Another important thing is that I have learned how to ask good questions and when to ask them. Before reaching out to another engineer for help,
I should have already spent a good amount of time and effort before first. If the problem still couldn’t be solved,
I would reach out to my colleagues and clearly explain the problem statement, the expected outcome, and the things that I have tried.</p>

<h2>LO3 Demonstrate initiative and leadership skills whilst working alone and in teams<a class="headerlink" href="#lo3-demonstrate-initiative-and-leadership-skills-whilst-working-alone-and-in-teams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am glad to say that I have taken initiative in doing something and actually paid off.
I once proposed the usage of Sphinx to document our project since there wasn’t any sort of concise code documentation prior.
I took the initiative and spent some time studying and going through some trainings about Sphinx. After that, I prepared a quick demo and proposed it to the team.
They loved it and integrated Sphinx into the project, and I have been taking charge the code documentation part ever since,
reviewing other developer’s documentation to make sure it follows the best practices and guidelines.
I also constantly take the initiative to explore other technologies that might be beneficial to the team.</p>

<p>In college, we are taught about a lot of core software engineering topics such as Object oriented programming,
database management, design patterns, code documentation, unit testing, agile methodologies and many more.
I am glad that we learnt these topics because a lot of what I learnt is applicable to current project that I am working on.</p>

<p>Overall, I have learnt a lot so far in Qualcomm about software engineering through this internship.
I have learnt about the importance of project code documentation, unit testing, good code coverage, code reviews,
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment with tools like Jenkins.
As well as how to write good and concise code comments, how to improve code readability,
how to communicate with other team members in a professional manner, how to ask for help, how to debug code fast,
how to propose new ideas/solutions, and so many more. Overall, these skills and knowledge are super important to obtain,
and I am very happy to be learning from Qualcomm.
These skills and knowledge are transferable and will be brought along with me to my future career.</p>

<h1>Difficulties Experienced<a class="headerlink" href="#difficulties-experienced" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It’s totally normal and expected that there will be problems or difficulties that us interns will experience.
One of the main difficulties I experienced was that most engineers here in Qualcomm speak in hardware/electrical related jargons and terms,
especially during meetings with people from other department. Coming from a software background, I had trouble understanding what exactly they are referring to.
I wasn’t sure if I should spend some time asking and try to understand all the jargons they use or if I can get away without knowing exactly what they mean.</p>
<p>Another issue I faced is team project related. When I first joined the team project in January,
I was spending a good amount of time reading the documentation of the project.
However, I had difficulty understanding because of the sub-par organization and layout of the documentation.
Some docs are outdated, so it’s misleading, some docs are missing blank. That caused me more time than necessary to pick up and understand the project.
I eventually understood more about the project by setting up meetings with colleagues and ask for their help explaining certain
topics to me. And to make sure the next new-comer won’t face the same issue as I did, I took the initiative and proposed a collaborative team effort
to use Sphinx to document our project as detailed as possible.</p>

<section id="technical">
<h2>Technical<a class="headerlink" href="#technical" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Simple code is better than complicated</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When writing code, always choose the easiest and simplest option that will get the job done. Simple and clear to understand code will
give other developers a better time reading and debugging it. Always Keep It Stupid Simple (KISS). I used to try to implement all
the functionalities at one go, which in the end, some if not most of the functionalities become useless. What I learnt is that I should
only add more functionalities when new demands arise. With this, I can achieve a lean development software.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Code needs to be written in a way so that it is understable not just by the developer who wrote it, but also by other developers that
maintain the code. If hig-performance code is so complicated that is almost impossible for other developers to figure out, then it’s
probably bad code. On the other hand, just because a piece of code is easy to explain to someone else doesn’t mean it isn’t bad code either.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When writing code, we are most likely following the system design the developers laid out before the project started.
This means that there are project specific guidelines when writing code and we should follow them and not just code in
any way we like although the end output might be the same. If you find your implementation can’t fit the current system
design architecture, you might be tempted to come up with some quick hack methods. However, this will only lead to
inconsistent and unreadable code. At the same time, forcing yourself to adhere to rules and guidelines can also result to
abstract and unredable code too. So, we need to learn how to walk the line in between.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Test Driven Development (TDD)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>TDD is a concept which tests are written first and then code is written in order to pass the tests.
When all the tests pass, the code is then complete. TDD is an efficient process that ensures clean and reusable code.
At first, I struggled to wrap my head around this concept as I am so used to writing tests after coding.
After writing more tests in TDD manner, I found that I began to write more direct and efficient code more effortlessly.</p>

<h2>Non-technical<a class="headerlink" href="#non-technical" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Know when and how to ask questions</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When you are stuck at a problem, before reaching out to someone else for help, make sure that you have at least attempted to solve the problem
yourself. When reaching out for someone, explain clearly the problem statement, the desired goal and show them your attempts to solve the problem.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Learn something enough to be able to teach someone else</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I feel like this concept applies to everything. If you want to be truly good at something, you need to learn it enough so
that you are capable to explain and teach someone else in a simple language. In my opinion, being able to understand complex
concepts thoroughly and explain something in an eloquent way are the two important skills required to become a good developer.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid to propose something new</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you have an idea that you genuinely think that it can be beneficial to the team project, you mustn’t stay quiet.
Instead, you should be confident and voice out your opinions and ideas to the team.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Have Fun!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Lastly, I learnt that internships are meant to be enjoyable and fun. So, take advantage of all the resources and try to learn
as much as possible, make new connections with people, and enjoy the time while it lasts!</p>
