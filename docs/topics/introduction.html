<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>My name is Tan, Yi Ming. I am third year student from Malaysia, studying software development in MTU Cork.
I am currently working as a software engineer intern at Qualcomm as part of the work placement module of the course.</p>
<p>To me, doing internships in general is extremely valuable as it helps to gain real-world software engineering knowledge and experience.
And I am very fortunate enough to be doing my internship here at Qualcomm, one of the best and largest technology companies in the world.
I honestly believe that gaining work experience during college provides a huge head start advantage.
It allows me to correlate all the subjects I have learnt in college during the past two and a half years with actual real life scenarios in the tech world.
It also prepares me for my future career by getting real meaningful work experience under my belt straight out of university.</p>
<p>This is actually my second internship with Qualcomm. I did a 10 week summer internship with Qualcomm during my second year of college from July to September 2021,
fully remote. I absolutely loved it, I enjoyed my time working in the company,
I learnt so much within the 10 week period and I am glad that I am doing my third year work placement here at Qualcomm again in 2022.
I am super grateful to be given the chance to gain experience at Qualcomm during summer last year.</p>
<p>My current work placement duration started from the 4th of January 2022,
and the end date is recently extended from June to September 16th. Mode of work is blended,
I can either work remotely from home or in the Penrose Dock, Cork office. My line manager is Mohamed Wahbi,
he is the one I go to if I have any questions about the internship, the work, career or life advice and many more.
I also report to my project manager Kalpesh Shah from Bangalore, India, whom I work with in an infrastructure project team.</p>
