<h1>Future Career Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#future-career-planning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Working as a software engineer intern at Qualcomm for these past few months has led me to realize that
how lucky and fortunate I am to have chosen the right major and career path three years ago.
I love what I do, I enjoy working as a software engineer, I love all the aspects of it, I really do.
This current internship at Qualcomm just further deepened and strengthened my passion for software engineering.
I am very thankful for Qualcomm for giving me this fantastic opportunity and experience.
I now have no doubt about what I want to do in the future, my future goal is very I want to be
the best software engineer I possibly can.</p>

<h1>Last Words<a class="headerlink" href="#last-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>All in all, I absolutely enjoy my time here currently in Qualcomm.
This has been the best time and experience for me as a software development student here in Cork, Ireland.
Even though it has only been 5 months, I know for a fact that I have learnt and grew so much.
I am being taught the best practices of coding in Python and software development in general by the best engineers.
Not only that, but I can also tell that my soft skills have improved significantly as well.
I learned how to communicate with a professional manner, how to interact with other engineers and build meaningful
connections and relationships not just here in Cork, but also in San Diego and Bangalore.
I can confidently say that Qualcomm is a great place to work in, and I am going to keep it up,
do my best and enjoy the rest of the internship!</p>
